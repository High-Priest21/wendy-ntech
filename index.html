                                but it can also be stylized and abstracted and carved from stone. ... They are often used as a form of
                                communication between people and supernatural forces and beings. African art describes the modern and historical
                                paintings, sculptures, installations, and other visual culture from native or indigenous Africans and the African
                                continent. The definition may also include the art of the African diasporas, such as African American, Caribbean
                                or art in South American societies inspired by African traditions. Despite this diversity, there are unifying
                                artistic themes present, when considering the totality of the visual culture from the continent of Africa.
                                    Masquerade, metalwork, sculpture, architecture, fiber art, and dance are important art forms across Africa
                                    and may be included in the study of African art. The term "African art" does not usually include the art of
                                    the North African areas along the Mediterranean coast, as such areas had long been part of different traditions.
                                    For more than a millennium, the art of such areas had formed part of Berber or Islamic art, although with many
                                    particular local characteristics. The art of Ethiopia, with a long Christian tradition, is also different from
                                    that of most of Africa, where traditional African religion (with Islam in the north) was dominant until relatively
                                    recently.[2] African art includes ancient art, Islamic art of West Africa, the Christian art of East Africa, and the ritualistic art of these and other regions. Most African sculpture was historically in wood and other natural materials that have not survived from earlier than, at most, a few centuries ago; older pottery figures can be found from a number of areas.[3] Masks are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized. There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among "groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the Niger and Congo rivers" in West Africa.[4] Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for religious ceremonies; today many are made for tourists as "airport art".[5] Since the late 19th century there has been an increasing amount of African art in Western collections, the finest pieces of which are now prominently displayed.
                                    African art has had an important influence on European Modernist art, which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction. It was this appreciation of African sculpture that has been attributed to the very concept of "African art", as seen by European and American artists and art historians.[7]
                                    West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs, like the famous Benin Bronzes, to decorate palaces and for highly naturalistic royal heads from around the Bini town of Benin City, Edo State, as well as in terracotta or metal, from the 12th–14th centuries. Akan goldweights are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400–1900; some apparently represent proverbs, contributing a narrative element rare in African sculpture; and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements. Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The Mande-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces from wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.
                                    Art from Tanzania is known for modern Tinga Tinga paintings and Makonde sculptures. Like in other regions, there is also a diversified tradition of producing textile art.[4] The culture from Great Zimbabwe left more impressive buildings than sculpture, but the eight soapstone Zimbabwe Birds appear to have had a special significance and were presumably mounted on monoliths. Modern Zimbabwean sculptors in soapstone have achieved considerable international success. Southern Africa's oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 AD and have cylindrical heads with a mix</P>

                            <P class="love">The centre of African art lies in West Africa, the region stretching from Senegal eastwards to Lake Chad. Beyond the Niger, artistic inspiration is limited to applied art and crafts and some ornamental decorative art. The Benue joining the Niger forms the border of another region of sculpture stretching eastwards and south-eastwards and embracing Angola and the Congo basin. Thus the whole area can be divided into two spheres: the Sudan sphere round the Gulf of Guinea, and, the Congo sphere which lies to the east and south-east of it between the Atlantic and the great Lakes. To the south of Tanzania and in Mozambique lives the Makonde tribe, an isolated group of plastic artists. The Bantu tribes of South Africa, who are highly developed both mentally and physically, show considerable artistic talent, but their plastic art is poor compared with that of the Congo basin and the West. Their best wood-carving comes in the form of headrests, and occasional animal figures of interest. It is however the work of the western region which has made the African famous as a sculptor in wood. Wood sculpture is the classical tribal art of Africa. To some people Benin bronze sculpture represents even finer work, but it would probably be wrong to consider these as purely African, because the technique of bronze casting is believed to have been introduced from abroad</P>

            <hr>
            <P>Pole Sculpture in Wood The principal merit of African wood sculpture has been defined by the English art critic Roger Fry as complete plastic freedom. African artists really conceive form in three dimensions and seem to have no difficulty in getting away from the two-dimensional plane. There is a simple explanation of the ease with which sculptors in Africa have grasped the round and hence cylindrical form of the human body. It lies in the material and in the technique imposed by it. The sculptor starts with a section of tree-trunk - a round block of wood. If the construction is simple, the block of wood remains clearly recognisable as a cylinder. The classical examples are the roughly fashioned ancestor figures of the Bari, and the colossal pole sculptures of the Azande, both in the Eastern Sudan. If further cubic forms, similarly arrived at are applied to this basic cylinder, the result is an almost geometric style. The trunk is one solid cylinder, the arms are smaller cylinders running parallel to the body, and the head is strongly stylised. Geometric-style abstract sculpture of this type have been produced in their highest artistic form by the Babe tribe in Western Sudan.
                The style is by no means confined to Africa; the same development is found in American Indian art (notably of the northwest USA), Oceanic art, as well as that of Siberia and Indo-China. The principle of pole sculpture is also applied to masks. In the nature of things the mask is always half-cylindrical, and the artist has so little opportunity to elaborate this half-cylinder that it remains the predominant form. This style was developed by tribes like the Hopi Indians in North America. In Africa, masks of this kind are to be found in the Ivory coast and in the Nilotic region.</P>

                                    native or indigenous Africans and the African continent. The definition may also include the art of the 
                                    African diasporas, such as African American, Caribbean or art in South American societies inspired by 
                                    African traditions. Despite this diversity, there are unifying artistic themes present, when considering 
                                    the totality of the visual culture from the continent of Africa.
                                    Masquerade, metalwork, sculpture, architecture, fiber art, and dance are important art forms across Africa 
                                    and may be included in the study of African art. The term "African art" does not usually include the art of 
                                    the North African areas along the Mediterranean coast, as such areas had long been part of different 
                                    traditions. For more than a millennium, the art of such areas had formed part of Berber or Islamic art,
                                    although with many particular local characteristics. The art of Ethiopia, with a long Christian tradition,
                                    is also different from that of most of Africa, where traditional African religion (with Islam in the north)
                                    was dominant until relatively recently. African art includes ancient art, Islamic art of West Africa,
                                    the Christian art of East Africa, and the ritualistic art of these and other regions. Most African sculpture
                                    was historically in wood and other natural materials that have not survived from earlier than,
                                    at most, a few centuries ago; older pottery figures can be found from a number of areas. Masks are important
                                    elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized. There is a vast
                                    variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but
                                    wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among "groups of settled cultivators in the
                                    areas drained by the Niger and Congo rivers" in West Africa.[4] Direct images of deities are relatively
                                    infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for religious ceremonies; today many are made
                                    for tourists as "airport art".[5] Since the late 19th century there has been an increasing amount of
                                    African art in Western collections, the finest pieces of which are now prominently displayed.
                                    African art has had an important influence on European Modernist art, which was inspired by their lack of
                                    concern for naturalistic depiction. It was this appreciation of African sculpture that has been attributed
                                    to the very concept of "African art", as seen by European and American artists and art historians.
                                    West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs, like the famous Benin Bronzes, to decorate
                                    palaces and for highly naturalistic royal heads from around the Bini town of Benin City, Edo State, as well
                                    as in terracotta or metal, from the 12th–14th centuries. Akan goldweights are a form of small metal sculptures
                                    produced over the period 1400–1900; some apparently represent proverbs, contributing a narrative element rare
                                    in African sculpture; and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements. Many West African figures
                                    are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings.
                                    The Mande-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces from wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and
                                    legs shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include
                                    heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.
                                    Art from Tanzania is known for modern Tinga Tinga paintings and Makonde sculptures. Like in other regions, there
                                    is also a diversified tradition of producing textile art. The culture from Great Zimbabwe left more impressive 
                                    buildings than sculpture, but the eight soapstone Zimbabwe Birds appear to have had a special significance and were 
                                    presumably mounted on monoliths. Modern Zimbabwean sculptors in soapstone have achieved considerable international
                                    success. Southern Africa's oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 AD and have cylindrical heads with a mix</P>
